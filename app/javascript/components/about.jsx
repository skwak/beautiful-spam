        When I am very desperate for something, I will occasionally check my spam box.
        I seek to have nearly-missed some kind of communication that mistakenly made its
        way into my spam.
      </p>

      <p>
        But what happens is that I will not find anything. And even though I know that
        I need not click, I do anyway on the more interesting spam titles without attachments,
        because I am there anyway. I might as well see. Maybe it will be interesting.
        Maybe I will discover a spam that is not really a spam, even though it certainly looks like a spam.
        xXXXXXXXboba-tea-100030@live-she-ru.com wants to talk to you!
        Maybe I will forget myself for just a little bit.

        Sometimes there is a kind of beauty I see in these emails, in the strange wordings that
        tug at basic human desires, without much intentional beauty,
        naked in their intentions and their committal to bypass
        the filters they failed to bypass.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the beauty drifts away once I realize some kind of faceless entity
        sees me as a faceless entity to be sent mostly meaningless messages to.
        I am not special. I have never been special,
        and there is no magic in the world, I tell myself. The world is mundane, and it is hard,
        although it can be nice sometimes, too, but I did not want to be reminded of any of that
        or to think about any of that.
      </p>

      <p>
        If I was special, if there was magic in the world,
        these are the spam emails I would receive, and I wouldn't have written them
        myself.

        I would be more explicit, and give you some more stuctured meaning, but I am trying to be spam here. This is my job.
        Have you heard about the career fair?
